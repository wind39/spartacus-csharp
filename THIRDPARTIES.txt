SIMPLIFIED LICENSE NOTICE FOR FIREBIRD AND FIREBIRD EMBEDDED:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Firebird is a free, open-source database management system, but “free” does not mean that everything is permitted. The use of Firebird is governed by two licenses: the IPL (InterBase Public License) and the IDPL (Initial Developer's Public License). The first one covers the parts of the source code that were inherited from InterBase; the second applies to the additions and improvements made by the Firebird Project. Both licenses offer similar rights and restrictions. In short:

Use of the software is free, even for commercial purposes. You may also redistribute the software, separately or with a product of your own, but you may not claim ownership or credit for it. Any license notices included with Firebird must remain intact.

You may modify and recompile the Firebird source code or parts of it. You may distribute such modified versions, but if you do so, you must document your modifications and make them publicly available, at no cost, under the same license as the original code.

You may include Firebird source code (modified or not) in a larger work and distribute that larger work, in source and/or compiled form, under a license of your own choosing. You need not publicize the source code for the entire larger work, but you must fulfill the license conditions for the parts that were taken from Firebird, whether they were modified or not.

Please notice that the above is a simplified overview. Only the original license texts are legally binding. You can find them here:

FOSS EXCEPTION FOR MYSQL:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Oracle’s Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception (formerly known as the FLOSS License Exception) allows developers of FOSS applications to include Oracle's MySQL Client Libraries (also referred to as "MySQL Drivers" or "MySQL Connectors") with their FOSS applications. MySQL Client Libraries are typically licensed pursuant to version 2 of the General Public License ("GPL"), but this exception permits distribution of certain MySQL Client Libraries with a developer’s FOSS applications licensed under the terms of another FOSS license listed below, even though such other FOSS license may be incompatible with the GPL.
