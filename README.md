Spartacus is a business library written in C#, focused on:
  - Access many types of databases in a fast, easy to use and generic way;
  - Render reports from a unique XML markup to PDF, using own database objects;
  - Really fast import and export spreadsheets (CSV, DBF and XLSX), with no need of Excel or any other piece of software;
  - Easy to work with cryptography of files and messages;
  - Simple networking classes (server, client, webserver, etc);
  - Simple 2D game engine over System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms.
