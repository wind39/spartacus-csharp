This is the Developer's Kit package for DotNetZip v1.9.  This package was packed Sat-08-06-2011-215945.06.  In this zip you will find Debug and Release DLLs for the various versions of the assemblies: Ionic.Zip, Ionic.Zlib, and Ionic.BZip2.  There is a separate top-level folder for each distinct version of the DLL, and within those top-level folders there are Debug and Release folders.  In the Debug folders you will find a DLL, a PDB, and an XML file for the given library, while the Release folder will have just a DLL.  The DLL is the actual library (either Debug or Release flavor), the PDB is the debug information, and the XML file is the intellisense doc for use within Visual Studio.  There are also files containing the documentation. If you have any questions, please check the forums on http://www.codeplex.com/DotNetZip
